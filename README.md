Personal AI Life Assistant — SOFTEC 2025
University life is a balancing act — juggling deadlines, group projects, society work, mental health, and future career dreams, often all at once.
Whether it’s a missed quiz or forgotten assignment, the chaos is real.
Imagine an assistant who not only organizes your life, but understands it.
Not just a digital planner, but an empathetic, intelligent buddy.
This year, the challenge is to design and develop a mobile app that serves as a Personal AI Life Assistant — helping students plan, prioritize, reflect, and grow through intelligent features and thoughtful design.
